LocalStack allows for transparent collection of execution events, in order to provide usage analytics and insights into the testing process overall. Simply configure your system with the `LOCALSTACK_API_KEY` environment variable, and the system will start making your events accessible on the LocalStack dashboard at https://app.localstack.cloud/dashboard.
