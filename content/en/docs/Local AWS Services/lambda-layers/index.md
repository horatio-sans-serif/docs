[Lambda layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html) are an AWS feature that allows to pull in additional code and content into your Lambda functions.

Simply point your Lambda client code at your LocalStack instance, e.g., running on http://localhost. For more details on how to use Lambda layers, please follow the documentation and examples on the [AWS website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html).
