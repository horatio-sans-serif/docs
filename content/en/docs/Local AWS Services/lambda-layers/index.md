[Lambda layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html) are a new AWS feature that allows to pull in additional code and content into your Lambda functions.

Simply point your Lambda client code at your LocalStack instance, e.g., running on http://localhost. For more details on how to use Lambda layers, please follow the documentation and examples on the [AWS website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html).
